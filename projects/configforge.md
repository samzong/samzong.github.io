## Introduction

ConfigForge is an open-source configuration management tool for macOS users,
supporting visual management of SSH and Kubernetes configurations.
It provides a simple UI to manage the '~/.ssh/config' and '~/.kube/config' files,

allowing you to easily to manage various configurations,
avoiding the cumbersome and error risks of directly editing text files.

As a completely open-source project, ConfigForge respects users' privacy and freedom.
All code is transparent and publicly available, ensuring that your configuration is safe and reliable.

## Features

- 🖥️ Intuitive GUI for managing SSH hosts and KubeConfig files.
- ⚡️ Command-line tool cf for quick host connection and config switching.
- 🔒 Comprehensive SSH host management, supporting all standard directives and auto-detecting entries in .ssh/config.
- ☁️ Manage multiple KubeConfig files separately in .kube/configs without merging clusters.

## Installation

Recommend using Homebrew to install and update; `cf` command will be added to your PATH automatically.

```bash
brew tap samzong/tap
brew install configforge
```

If you still can't open the app, run this command in Terminal:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/ConfigForge.app
```

## SSH Config Host Key

OpenSSH is a widely used secure remote login tool, and its configuration file `.ssh/config` allows users to define connection settings for different hosts.
The `Host` section is the core of the configuration file, used to specify configuration options for particular hosts.
